# Cross border finance

Jorge Guerrero

## Goal

The goal has not changed. This project aims to explore international lending and borrowing patterns, using data from the Bank for International Settlements’ Locational Banking Statistics (LBS).

The visualizations will allow users to interactively examine how financial connections between countries have evolved, who the main lenders and borrowers are, and how financial exposure varies by region or income group.

The goal is to make complex global finance network data more readable/easy to explore in the international financial system. From the 4 planned visualizations I dropped the interactive scatter plot as I decided it had little added value compared to the static version.

## Data Challenges

At this stage all data is real. Going forward I would need to make more API requests if the project is expanded to more granular data (currency, type of financial institutions).

## Questions

{Numbered list of questions for course staff, if any.}

1. Do you think the interactivity is enough? What changes would help for the final deliverable?
2. The color choice is consistent with the static view and the greater palette, would you suggest further changes or color tweaks?
3. Would you add more data detail? Such as currency and type of financial institutions? What balance should more data vs simpler terms should I aim for?
